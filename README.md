## Unfinished Components

On Slideshow Component, there is a function that will get all images from our images table. This component renders and function works properly. However, the purpose for This component was to show a slideshow instead of showing all images in disorder way. We
tried to use React-Slideshow-imaga, the libaray did not crash the app, but the slideshow was never created. Attempted to use another libray which was more complete and recently updated, however, it did crash the app and couldnÂ´t find the bug given.

Image galleries for cohorts, sorted by event into albums.

- __Multiple Cohort Support__
Extend the app to allow for multiple future cohorts.
